# Crescente on PEMS 2023 - Open Handmade Music

PEMS 2023 (Porto Electronic Music Symposium) happened for the first time in Casa da Música on the 15th and the 16th december.
I was gently invited to participate on the Open Handmade Music section to showcase Crescente to PEM's participants and community. It worked as a semi-informal presentation where I had the pleasure to explain how Crescente came to be, some of its features and the gesture to sound mappings. This Open Handmade Music section also received the presence of Rodrigo Constanzo and Gustavo Costa. I'd like to show my gratitude to them for all the good times we spent together and the generosity they've always shown. I'd also like to thank the team at Digitópia for the invitation, especially Óscar Rodrigues, Ricardo M. Vieira and Filipe Fernandes.
