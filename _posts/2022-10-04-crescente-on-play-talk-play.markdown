# Improvisation with Crescente on play talk play

Last month I've had the pleasure of being invited by Rodrigo Constanzo to participate in his series "play talk play". It was a great time to get to know him and Angela Guyton, both such welcoming and sweet people. We had the chance to talk a little bit about our musical setups, other cool hardware and some ideas about future projects. As for the rest of the conversation, you can watch it on the video below, along with two improvisation moments which turned out really nice.
