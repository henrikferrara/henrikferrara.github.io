# fhosfhorus at montra - mostra de arte 2023

On the 18th of november, 2023, the "fhosfhorus" live performance was presented at Café Nacional, in Vila do Conde, on the context of "montra - mostra de arte 2023". This performance was created by Francisca Dores and Henrik Ferrara and it is a direct continuation of the works performed under the name "Forças Atuantes, Corpos em Repouso". The 𝘧𝘩𝘰𝘴𝘧𝘩𝘰𝘳𝘶𝘴 project was born in 2023 out of a desire to explore audiovisual expressiveness in installation and live performance. Based on experimentation and improvisation, a dialogue is established between what is heard and what is seen, which survives only in the obsolescence of the objects used. Inspired by spirals and the effects that sound, image and gesture can have on the senses, a performative landscape is composed with a floating video camera, psychedelic CRT televisions, invented noise machines and synthesizers. These are intense and organic images that, in the realm of abstraction, refer to industrial landscapes, electrical signals and luminous spirals.
