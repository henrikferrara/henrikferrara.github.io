# Slipped Through the Closed Door by Weathervane Recs

Ainda no período conturbado de incerteza e confinamento de 2020 a Weathervane continuou a reunir músicos, desafiando-os com temas ou moods para novos lançamentos. Em "Slipped Through the Closed Door" a proposta foi de música experimental dançável.

"The third Weathervane compilation of quarantined musicians is dedicated to the experimental side of dance music, exploring how the drive to dance can inform new ways of sound creation. Slipping through a closed door reserved to conventional and commodified dance music, experimental producers have found a way to find a unique voice and share it a growingly interested and open audience. With the impact of covid lockdown, one can only work towards seeing that work bloom again."
