# Biography


Henrik Ferrara (1997), multidisciplinary musician and author, explores the infinitely vast territories of sound. His work embeds improvisation and experimentation, reflecting a constant search for innovation in his timbral palettes and methods of manipulating sound objects. As well as seeking to incorporate the production of noise with greater visual expressiveness, he also researches the energetic relationships of sound on the audience and on bodies in interaction with space, dialoguing with the materials of video, performance and dance.
He is developing new expressive interfaces, such as Crescente, an electroacoustic feedback instrument that produces immersive soundscapes. He collaborates with Francisca Dores in the performance project “fhosfhorus”, exploring symbioses of visual and sound feedback, and designs the sound for her films. He composed the album “ATAVÍSTICO”, with a visceral and melancholic language, produced music with Guillio in “Songs For Green Tea and Peppermint Pope”, exploring noise rock and ambient abstractions. He directed Coro Normal with Simão Collares, creating a space for vocal and sound experimentation, and founded the collective OBSOLETO (formerly LickSickDick), of which the shows “Plasticidade” and “Trabalhar Rápido é Trabalhar Pior” stand out.
He currently creates and performs in the “Pleasure Drone” project (with Gil Mac), where he explores dance music sonorities, expanding his sound universe to clubbing and rave. 
He has a degree in Audiovisual Communication Technologies (ESMAD) and a master's degree in Sound Design and Interactive Music (FEUP). He currently teaches at the Escola Artística e Profissional Árvore and at the Escola Superior de Educação of the Instituto Politécnico de Viana do Castelo (IPVC). He is a collaborating member in uniMAD, research center of Escola Superior de Media Artes e Design (ESMAD).
