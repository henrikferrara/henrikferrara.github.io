Released June 10th, 2023, "ATAVISTICO" is Henrik Ferrara's debut album, "A slow passage in the midst of storms. We are taken by the sounds and the boat, then by gravity, and finally by an imperative call from the Cosmos. The story of the wreckage of a constructed body that, at the moment of confrontation with the abyss, is unknown. The sounds of violence, of the bowels of mountains, of city pipes, of other people's memories, of animal fossils, of our embryonic body, of the dark and the mother. Atavistic suggests a listening narrative, through an exercise in synthesis delivered to a set of colossal forces that trap human smallness in the present, the unique place of stage".

# Crescente
[!["Crescente 2"](/assets/music/crescente2.jpg){:width="100%"}](/assets/music/crescente2.jpg)
"Crescente" is a prototype of a mixed musical instrument. It presents itself as a DMI (Digital Music Instrument) with some qualities imported from the electro-acoustic universe. Its main characteristics are inscribed in its ability to reproduce, through gesture mapping, a polyphonic FM synthesizer processed by a delay effect. In parallel, the instrument offers the possibility of creating electroacoustic feedback loops, as the sound produces resonance in the very materials of the box it structures, due to the use of a contact transducer. This resonance can be picked up by the piezo built into the front face, a signal that is later fed back to the DSP through a block of Karplus Strong synthesis.

# Forças Atuantes, Corpos em Repouso

"Forças Atuantes, Corpos em Repouso" is an audiovisual performance where Francisca Dores and Henrik Ferrara play together with image and sound, a performance for two, in which the production of sound and the production of the visual score in real time assume an interdependent relationship and create loops of stimuli, an audiovisual feedback. Thus, from the black screen (the dark, the silence) the journey begins. The first command comes from the television screen and the gesture that manipulates the camera which, in the dark, finds information that is translated on the screen into night vision images. These first images provide the stimulus for the production of sound and, from then on, all the interactions and shapes inherent to the noise-producing objects themselves become material that can be the focus of the camera and, consequently, the next beat in the score that is built in real time.

# ATA OWWO

ATA OWWO is a music project that started back in 2015 with my early exploration needs in music and sound creation. Back then, I was heavily inspired by the Witch House scene and its aesthetics. Improvisation and exploration approaches to music-making were also characteristics that defined the project early on. As time went by, it evolved, with each release, to a subsequently free approach to electronic music. Some of the tracks have had contribuitions by other musicians.

In 2019, ATA OWWO and GUILLIO decided to record an album together, combining their styles and sound textures. With this record, these projects had their first "live" appearance on the internet, playing some songs from the album and demos that were left out of the release. The album was then released on 2020 during the Covid-19 confinement period.

ATA OWWO is an ongoing project and new works are currently in the making.


ATA OWWO é um projeto musical que começou em 2015 a partir de uma enorme vontade e necessidade de começar a explorar novas ferramentas de criação sonora. Nessa altura, senti-me muito inspirado pela onda de Witch House e toda a estética que caracterizava o estilo. A abordagem musical a partir da improvisação e experimentação são coisas que surgiram também nesta fase e que acabaram por definir de forma vincada os primeiros trabalhos com este projeto. Com o passar do tempo, evolução pessoal e crescimento do projeto, a cada lançamento, é cada vez mais seguro caracterizar ATA OWWO como uma abordagem musical livre nas paisagens da música eletrónica, contando, frequentemente, com a contribuição de outros músicos em algumas composições.

# Lick Sick Dick
The Lick Sick Dick collective was originally formed by Simão Rodrigues, Guilherme Correia and me as an idea for live shows which would blend the languages of music and theatre. As more people joined, such as Miguel Pereira, Mariana Teixeira, Bernardo Ribeiro and João Galvão, we began to explore in which ways we'd explore this blend, how we'd approach music making and storytelling on stage. We found out that, through music and our bodies, there were countless stories to tell and messages to transmit. Iniatially, Guilherme (Penumbra, Guillio) was composing an entire album as a vehicle for a handful of stories. As time went by, we understood that we had more to say and we found that we wanted to work on the spontaneous and exciting danger of improvisation as a group. When we started sketching our first show we had already worked a lot on improvisation practices and more theater approaches applied on music. We then got the help of Ana Pinho, Pedro Galante and Sara Correia to make our project gain a visual life too. Our first show was cancelled the day before it was meant to be due to "lack of technical supervision" from the festival in which it was accepted. We refused to cross arms and showed up anyway, to say what we had to say, without the art apparatus. Roughly six months later, we presented our actual first show, with two full sessions in a row.

Our collective keeps working, with more people joining and new ideas coming to life all the time. The most important thing that keeps us going is the joy to create together. Fell free to visit our Facebook page as we work on an official website.

# Geleia Mista

GELEIA MISTA (Mixed Jam) appears suddenly and quickly. It is a subformation of LickSickDick's collective maintained by Henrik Ferrara and Simão Rodrigues. Thanks to an online radio's open-call, Geleia Mista heads to the studio and records a soundtrack from improvised bits, all of them about trash, pollution and civilization. Geleia Mista may well become a single noisy shout but it can also be a jolly jingle for the entire happy family. Mixed Jam is made of love songs dedicated to trash and improvised cathartic spasms.



GELEIA MISTA surgiu de repente e rapidamente. Uma subformação do coletivo LickSickDick, composta por Henrik Ferrara e Simão Rodrigues. Graças a um open-call radiofónico, GM vai para o estúdio gravar uma composição sonora a partir de retalhos improvisados, todos sobre o lixo, a poluição e a civilização. GM pode tornar-se um grito barulhento mas pode também ser um refrão para toda a alegre família. São canções de amor ao lixo e são espasmos catárticos improvisados.
