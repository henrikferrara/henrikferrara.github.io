# Oficina de experimentação e alteração de circuitos eletrónicos e geradores de ruído, 
in Modos de Usar, Circular Festival

For approximately one month, I had the pleasure to be a part of this workshop, lead by sound artist and bend master Miguel Pipa, together with Francisca Dores.

During the few sessions we had, we went from the basics of creating electroacoustic sound objects and circuit bending to designing and performing with such objects and original graphic scores. These experiments and the work we developed on such short notice had a great impact on me and my quest for sonic exploration. On the final stages of the process, we prepared and presented an informal, intimate live show for which Joclécio Azevedo was so kind to give some advice regarding form, movement and intention.
